Idea 1: 
  I like to play a game called osu it is a rhythm game where you click and hold circles that appear on your screen to music. So I thought it would be fun to take specifically at the start the top osu player plays and analyze them to predict that statistical likely hood that they will pass the map and where they are most likely to mess up.
  There is no clear set data that I can super easily pull from. But in osu you are able to pull people top plays from maps so I can get the map info and the play which is where they clicked and aim their cursor and be able to cross reference them and yeah.
  
Idea 2:
  I saw that there is a lemon image database in the databases that you sent so it would be fun to look at that since one of my twitch mods name is Lemon it would be funny.
