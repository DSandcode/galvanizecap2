## Proposal: 1 Predicting who made an osu! map

osu! beatmap page: https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets

 - osu! is a game where you click circles to the beat of the song playing. In the game you play along to songs which are called maps. Since there are a lot of songs there are people who make maps for the game. Anyone can make maps but only certain maps qualify to be ranked. I am one who does such thing, and I find it quite fun and challenging. Ranked maps are maps that are good and playable this is done so that maps are made to be played. 
 
 Since there a lot of maps and mappers out there people have started creating there own style. So my idea is to make a bot which analyzes osu! maps and predicts who made them. This can be useful to help decide wether someone stole a map.
 
  While there is no direct database to pull from technically. You are able to download the maps for free off the website. They then make a file which is an .osu file. I would show an example but the file is long even for short easy maps, but there are parts at the bottom which define where stuff are placed. It also has info on who made the map at the top. So to get the data I would need to split it, which the file marks the sections. I would then compare the part to see patterns to figure out who mapped a map.

  
## Proposal: 2 Moldy Lemon
  
  Dataset: https://github.com/softwaremill/lemon-dataset
  
  - This dataset has a bunch of lenmon pics in it. Some are moldy and some are not so I could skan the images to see wheter or not the lemon is moldy.
